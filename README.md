DGInputAccessoryToolbar
=======================

A standard "prev/next/done" toolbar to put as inputAccessoryView for your keyboard (iOS / ObjC).
Because it is so annoying that these keyboards do not have a built-in way to dismiss them...

You need to supply the toolbar with `target`/`selector` for prev/next actions - otherwise those buttons will be invisible. The Done button is always visible.
